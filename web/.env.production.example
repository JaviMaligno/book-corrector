# Production Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.production for local production builds

# Backend API URL (set by Render automatically during deployment)
# For local production builds, set this to your deployed backend URL
VITE_API_URL=https://corrector-api-xxx.onrender.com

# Notes:
# - VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose variables to the client
# - These variables are baked into the JavaScript bundle at build time
# - Changing values requires rebuilding the frontend
# - On Render, this is automatically set from the backend service URL
